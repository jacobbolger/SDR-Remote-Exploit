Hello world


### Some Background Info on Our Project

Here we can talk about why we chose this topic

### Issues We Encountered
Let's discuss our issues and maybe include an image or two here


### Hardware List:

RTL-SDR - $40

Raspberry Pi 4 8gb Starter Kit by Canakit 

Antenna (an unshielded copper wire will work fine)

A device to perform the attack on, in our case a remotely controlled power outlet

### Software List:
Rpitx

SDR Sharp

### Describe our Procedure
Include all the images and videos I took as a demo


### Provide our Conclusion



### How we can expand upon this project
Next steps would be to do a proof of concept attack on a car key fob using a signal jammer or a garage door remote replay attack
By implementing a laptop to function as an RDP device and mobile hotspot, one could theoretically take this machine to a public location and perform an attack (we don't condone this)
