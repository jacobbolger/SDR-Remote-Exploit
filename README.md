Hello world


### Some Background Info on Our Project

All students intending to graduate with a Bachelors of Science in Cybersecurity must complete a relevant project during the CYBER-400 Capstone course at Mount Saint Mary's University. Though there were several ideas for projects to attempt, the final choice was a remote signal exploit reliant on a low-cost software-defined radio. This project presented an opportunity to exhibit skills we already possessed and a hands-on way to gain a multitude of new skills and proficiency in new software. A few walkthroughs on how this process can be accomplished already exist, but after watching several hours worth of content attempting to follow along, it was apparent that none of them would accomplish what we needed to do, for various reasons.


### Hardware List to Perform this Exploit:

[RTL-SDR](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/) 

[Raspberry Pi 4 8gb Starter Kit by Canakit](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-starter-kit.html) 

Antenna (an unshielded copper wire will work fine)

A device to perform the attack on, in our case a [remotely controlled power outlet](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WX2NBWR/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_AE8H60GDRJDAQ4TV17NA)

### Software List:
Rpitx

### Issues We Encountered
Before getting hands on with any hardware, we completed thorough background research including sourcing necessary hardware, determining software needed for various steps in the process, and possibly finding solutions to errors before we encountered them. However, oftentimes issues in projects are unavoidable, and we faced several along the way. 

The first issue we encountered involved running Rpitx on our Pi4. The creator of this software gives compatability notes for each release of the Raspberry Pi, and unfortunately it is still in beta for the Pi4. The most obstructive bug we discovered is that all video output from the Pi's onboard HDMI output is lost upon running the program, and therefore you cannot use your device until the Pi is restarted. Our workaround for this was to RDP into the Pi from a secondary computer. This had its quirks, but overall worked for what we needed it to do.

The second issue we had involved the copper wire we were using as an antenna. With the help of our software-defined radio, several tests could be conducted to measure the clarity of a signal output from the wire, which was attached to GPIO Pin 4 on the Pi. Demo versions of the final antenna chosen varied in length, thickness, if the wire was shielded or not, and the way in which the wire would be attached to the Pi. Here are just a few of the versions tested:
(have to convert image file)



### Describe our Procedure
Include all the images and videos I took as a demo

Regarding hardware, we began by attatching our antenna to the RPi4 and using the 
(must convert image).

Next, we boot up the RPi4 and launch rpitx, which allows us to listen and transmit from the Pi.

Within the GUI menu for rpitx, we were able to establish our desired transmission frequency.

From here, we tested out our trasnmission signal/strength via the RTL-SDR dongle and SDR# on an accompanying computer.

(i added this step prematurely within the order) Now that we are ready to listen on the RPi4, we established the frequency we want to listen/receive on.

### Provide our Conclusion



### How we can expand upon this project
Next steps would be to do a proof of concept attack on a car key fob using a signal jammer or a garage door remote replay attack
By implementing a laptop to function as an RDP device and mobile hotspot, one could theoretically take this machine to a public location and perform an attack (we don't condone this)
