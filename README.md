### Some Background Info on Our Project

All students intending to graduate with a Bachelors of Science in Cybersecurity must complete a relevant project during the CYBER-400 Capstone course at Mount Saint Mary's University. Though there were several ideas for projects to attempt, the final choice was a remote signal exploit reliant on a low-cost software-defined radio. This project presented an opportunity to exhibit skills we already possessed and a hands-on way to gain a multitude of new skills and proficiency in new software. A few walkthroughs on how this process can be accomplished already exist, but after watching several hours worth of content attempting to follow along, it was apparent that none of them would accomplish what we needed to do, for various reasons.


### Hardware List to Perform this Exploit:

[RTL-SDR](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/) 

[Raspberry Pi 4 8gb Starter Kit by Canakit](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-starter-kit.html) 

Antenna (an unshielded copper wire will work fine)

A device to perform the attack on, in our case a [remotely controlled power outlet](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WX2NBWR/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_AE8H60GDRJDAQ4TV17NA)

### Issues We Encountered
Before getting hands on with any hardware, we completed thorough background research including sourcing necessary hardware, determining software needed for various steps in the process, and possibly finding solutions to errors before we encountered them. However, oftentimes issues in projects are unavoidable, and we faced several along the way. 

The first issue we encountered involved running Rpitx on our Pi4. The creator of this software gives compatability notes for each release of the Raspberry Pi, and unfortunately it is still in beta for the Pi4. The most obstructive bug we discovered is that all video output from the Pi's onboard HDMI output is lost upon running the program, and therefore you cannot use your device until the Pi is restarted. Our workaround for this was to RDP into the Pi from a secondary computer. This had its quirks, but overall worked for what we needed it to do.

The second issue we had involved the copper wire we were using as an antenna. With the help of our software-defined radio, several tests could be conducted to measure the clarity of a signal output from the wire, which was attached to GPIO Pin 4 on the Pi. Demo versions of the final antenna chosen varied in length, thickness, if the wire was shielded or not, and the way in which the wire would be attached to the Pi. Here is an image of the final version chosen displaying how it connects to the Pi:

### Experiment Procedure


After recieving our Pi4 kit and constructing it, we went through the initial process of installing Raspbian and setting up various users within the OS. Our next steps involved installing our primary software, Rpitx. In addition, SDR# was installed on both our Pi and a Windows machine, mostly for the purpose of debugging. Finally, we needed to install the proper drivers to allow communication between the SDR and the software, which can be found on the manufacturer's website.

After some troubleshooting, we realized that we would need to remotely access the Pi in order to use Rpitx due to video output issues with this particular hardware/software combination. Using the Windows PC, we were able to properly launch and use the Rpitx software over RDP.

A convenient and intuitive GUI menu is included with the software, but a command-line approach can be utilized if desired. The command-line functionality was beneficial throughout the many hours spent troubleshooting communication and output errors, but ultimately our successful attack was performed using the GUI.

Once we finally had the ability to launch the Rpitx software and demo proper functionality, we were able to begin the attack on the remote control. Using SDR#, we listened at around the range that the remote and reciever were meant to communicate at, and with this approach were able to narrow down the actual operating frequency far closer than by just reading the writing on the devices.

Once the exact frequency of the remote-outlet communications was determined, we fired up Rpitx once again and told it to listen at the frequency we knew the remote would operate at.

Finally, with these steps in place, we were able to perform the attack, as shown in the video below:

![Here is a Video of the Attack in Action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60351966/161458593-60170f69-0c23-4a94-93fb-baa8eeeb7f7d.mp4)

This video demonstrates, initially, the signal being sent from the remote to the outlet while our Pi listens on the same frequency, which was determined earlier in the process. After listening to the communications occuring on this frequency, the signal is replayed to mimic the remote attempting to communicate, but instead this signal is actually coming from the Pi. This is an example of a replay attack, a fundemental type of vulnerability studied in cybersecurity, networking, and other fields. 


### Provide our Conclusion
Conclusion will be written soon, I still want to touch up the above text and attempt the attack on other devices before concluding anything, because that would greatly change how I conclude this information repository.


### How we can expand upon this project
Next steps would be to do a proof of concept attack on a car key fob using a signal jammer or a garage door remote replay attack.
This is accomplished by implementing a laptop to function as an RDP device, a phone to provide internet connectivity, and a power bank for our devices. With this setup one could theoretically take this machine to a public location and perform an attack on a home or vehicle (we don't condone this). By malicious actors, this setup could be scaled down to be far less unassuming, or otherwise could easily sit within an automobile without attracting much attention.
